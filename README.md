Code for CS 3210 (Principles of Programming Languages), Fall 2022

This repository has code shared with my students in CS 3210 (Principles of Programming Languages), Fall 2022, at MSU Denver. This course traces the evolution of programming languages, identifying and analyzing the contributions made by several significant languages and their successors. It provides the opportunity for the students to learn more about the main programming paradigms, namely: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logical. Specific issues related to programming language implementation, such as nesting block structures, static and dynamic scoping, interpreted and compiled languages, among others are discussed in this course.
