# Instructions 

Your goal in this programming assignment is to build an Expert System (ES) in Prolog. An ES is a software that uses logic to support its decisions, simulating a human expert in some domain. For example, a medical ES can be built to support physicians in their patients diagnosis process. 

It is totally up to you how to structure your ES. The ES framework discussed in class (refer to lesson 18) can be used as a starting point. You are also free to choose your ES domain, except animals (dogs, cats, and ducks) since we have been using this particular domain in our examples. Your ES must be able to "learn" from the user using dynamic clauses (both positive and negative ones). Your ES should also have a minimal number of 15 distinct classes.  For example, if the chosen domain is diseases your program should be able to diagnose at least 15 different diseases.  

A simple [animal](src/animal.pl) ES is provided.

# User Interface 

To facilitate testing and grading, your ES should have a standardized user interface described in this section.  The program starts when the user types "begin." in Prologâ€™s shell.  The system should then present a welcome message to the user together with some informative text.  For example:  

```
?- begin. 
Welcome to this ES about animals! 
I am going to ask questions about animal features. 
The questions might be yes-no or choice questions. 
Ready? 
```
 
Answering "yes." initiates a sequence of questions (e.g., yes/no questions) that ends when the system is able to lock on an answer OR the system exhausted all the questions that it is programmed to ask. If the user answers "no." to the "Ready?" question the program should immediately terminate with a "Bye!" message.  Below is an example-run where the system was able to find an answer.  

```
has fur? 
|: no. 
has feathers? 
|: yes. 
says quack? 
|: yes. 
I think your animal is a duck. 
```
 
The system should then ask the user for some feedback using a message like "Did I get it right?" Depending on how the user answers this final question, the system should react differently. For example:  

```
Did I get it right? |: yes. 
Nice!
``` 

OR  

```
Did I get it right? |: no. 
Not my fault! My designer did not give me enough information about animals. 
```
 
Below is an example-run when the system was NOT able to find an answer after exhausting all possible questions available.  

```
has fur? 
|: yes. 
says woof? 
|: no. 
says meow? 
|: no. 
has feathers? 
|: no. 
Hmmm, I could not figure this one out... 
```

Before exiting, the ES should display a message explaining how to start a new session.  For example:  

```
To try again, just type begin. 
```
 
Please note that each ES session should be independent from previous ones.  Therefore, you need to ***retract all*** of the dynamically added clauses before starting a new session.  

# Option-type Question

Your ES should have at least one option-type question.  An option question lets a user type in a value and it checks whether the value is in a list of options. For more information about option-type question, see the [color](src/colors.pl) example. 

# Requirements

To get full grade in this assignemnt your ES should fulfill the following requirements: 

* it should have dynamic clauses
* it should avoid asking the same question (ie, the system should learn ***yes*** and ***no*** answers or ***option***-based answers)
* the UI should follow the example in this document (messages can be different, but users should be able to start a session using ***begin***)
* the ES should have (at least) 15 different domain classes
* it should have at least 1 option-type of question
* each session should be independent of the others

# Program Submission 

You should name your Prolog source code ***es.pl***. Submit this file through Canvas.  If working with a partner, make sure you add both of your names in a comment section in the beginning of your source code.  

# Rubric 

+10 UI follows suggested model  

+15 KB has at least 15 categories of the selected domain  

+10 KB has at least 1 option-type question

+10 KB structure appropriately and rules follow logic and common sense 

+10 the system avoids asking the same question multiple times (in other words, your solution should save not only positive answers but also negative ones) 

+15 KB has dynamic clauses (i.e., it "learns" from the user responses and avoid asking the same question again) 

+5 Program resets dynamically added clauses when restarted using "begin." 

+25 Program works and does not crash or have any other unexpected behavior
