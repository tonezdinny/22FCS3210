To further practice list comprehension, implement the following functions in Scala:

a) find all of the numbers from 1–1000 that are divisible by 8.

b) find all of the numbers from 1–1000 that have a 6 in them.

c) count the number of spaces in a (given) string.

d) remove all of the vowels in a (given) string.

e) find all of the words in a (given) string that are less than 5 letters.

f) count the length of each word in a (given) string.

g) use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1–1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2–9).
