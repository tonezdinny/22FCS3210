# Sum Predicate

Write a **sum/2** predicate, where the 1st parameter is a list of numbers and the second parameter is the sum of all of the elements in the given list. For example: **sum([1, 2, 5], 8)** yields **true**. Make sure your solution is able to answer queries using a variable for the second parameter, such as: **sum([1, 2, 5], X)**.  

```
Tests: 

sum([], 0). 

sum([1, 2, 5], 8). 

sum([1, 2, 5], X). 
```
 
# Max Predicate

Write a **max/2** predicate, where the 1st parameter is a list of numbers and the second parameter is the greatest value of all of the elements in the given list. For example: **max([1, 2, 5], 5)** yields **true**. Make sure your solution is able to answer queries using a variable for the second parameter, such as: **max([1, 2, 5], X)**. 

```
Tests: 

max([1, 2, 5], 5). 

max([1, 2, 5], X). 
```
