-- Description: elections simulation with coroutines
-- Student Name(s):

PROPOSALS = 3
VOTERS    = 1000000

-- TODO #1: create a ballot and randomly assign 0 (no) or 1 (yes) to each proposal; then begin a timed loop of up to 10s (also random); at each iteration the function should yield; at the end of the loop, insert the ballot in the (given) ballot_box
function vote(ballot_box)
    
end

-- TODO #2: return a tally of the results as a percent of 1s (yes) that was given to each proposal
function tally_results(ballot_box) 
    
end

-- TODO #3: time when the election started

-- TODO #4: create a ballot_box

-- TODO #4 create an array of "vote" coroutines

-- TODO #5: schedule the coroutines so each has a fair chance of running until completion

-- TODO #6: display the results

-- TODO #7: show how long the election took in seconds
