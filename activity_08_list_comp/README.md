# Instructions

Use Python's list comprehension feature to generate the following lists. 

```
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

```
[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
```

```
[1, 16, 49, 100]
```

```
# only integers from 
[ 2, 3.75, .04, 59, .3, 6, 7, 8.5, 9, 10 ]
```

```
1-1000 divisible by 7
```

```
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
b = [2, 7, 1, 12]
# tuples (x, y), x from a, y from b, x + y > 10
```
